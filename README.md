# human-vs-anime-prediction

his project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of distinguishing between human and anime images. The model has been trained to classify input images into two categories: human or anime.

Project Overview:
Model Architecture: Utilizes a CNN-based deep learning approach for image classification.
Dataset: A curated dataset of labeled human and anime images for training and testing.
Implementation: Built using Python, leveraging libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV.
Performance: Achieves high accuracy in distinguishing human faces from anime characters through feature extraction and pattern recognition.
Features:
Preprocessing: Includes image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
Model Training: Uses a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
Evaluation: Includes accuracy metrics and confusion matrix visualization.
Prediction: Upload any image to get a classification result (human or anime).
